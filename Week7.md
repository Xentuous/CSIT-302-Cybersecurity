## GDPR, ISO27001, NIST, Cybersecurity Framework

- ### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Basics

    * Date announed: 25th May 2018

    * Made by: European Union

    * Designed to harmonise data privacy laws across all member countries

    * Purpose: Alter how businesses and other organisations handle information of those that interact with them. Potential large fines and reputational damages for those breach the rules

    * Regarded as progressive approach to how peoples' personal data should be handled

<br>

- ### Where GDPR Applies to

    * Personal Data
        * ***ANY*** data that allow a person to be identified

        * Person's name, location data, online username, IP addresses and cookie identifiers and even pseudonymised data

    <br>

    * Sensitive personal data
        * Information about racial or ethinic origin
        * Political opinions
        * Religious or philosophical beliefs
        * Memership of trade unions
        * Genetic and biometric data
        * Health information
        * Data about person's sex life or orientation

    <br>

    * Controllers vs Processors
        * Controllers are main decision-makers that exercise overall controll over the purpose and means of processing personal data

        * Processors act on behalf of, and only on the instructons of, the relevant controller

        * Under GDPR, individuals, organisations and companies are either controllers or processors

        * Controllers have stricter obligations under GDPR than processors

<br>

- ### Key Principles of GDPR
    
    * 7 key principles of GDPR in Article 5:
        1. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
        
        <br>
        
        2. Purpose Limitation
        
        <br>

        3. Data minimisation
            * Organisation should not collect more personal information than required from users

            * Organisation should identify minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil their purpose

            * Principle is to ensure organisations do not overreach with the type of data collected about people
                * Very unlikely that an online retailer would need to collect people's political opinions when they sign up to the retailer's email mailing list.

        <br>

        4. Accuracy
        
        <br>

        5. Storage limitation
        
        <br>
        
        6. Integerity and Confidentiality (Security)
            * Personal data must be protected against unauthorised ir unlawful processing as well as accidental loss, destruction or damage

            * Appropriate information security protections must be in palce to make sure information is not accessed by hackers or leaked as part of data breach

            * GDPR does not specify what good security practices look like, but mandates proper access control to information that needs to be protected
                * Websites should be encrypted and pseudonymisation is reccomended
        
        <br>

        7. Accountability
            * Documentation of how personal data is handled and steps taken to ensure only people who need to access some information are granted access

            * Inlcude training staff in data protection measures and regularly evaluating and data handling processes

            * Company with more than 250 employees, it is a MUST to document of why people's information is being collected and processed, descriptions of information that is held, how long it's being kept for and descriptions of technical security measures in place

            * GDPR Article 30:
                * Mandates most organisations need to keep record of their data processing, and describes how data is shared and stored
            
            <br>

            * Organisations that conduct ***REGULAR AND SYSTEMATIC MONITORING OF INDIVIDUALS*** at a large scale or process a large amount of ***SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA*** must employ Data Protection Officer (DPO)
                * DPO report to senior members of staff, monitor compliance with GDPR and a Point of Contact for employees and customers

            <br>

            * Crucial for organisation if an organisation is being investigated for potentially breaching one of GDPR's principles. Having accurate record of all systems in place, how information is processed and steps taken to mitigate errors will help organisation to prove to regulators that it takes GDPR obligation seriously

## ISO 27001: Information Security Management Framework

- ## ISO 27001
    * More of a certification kind of framework, organisation have to get accredition 

    * Purpose of ISO 27001 framework
        * Combination of policies and processes for organisations to use

        * Provides a framework to help organisations of any size or any industry to protect their information in a systematic and cost-effective way through **INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ISMS)**

    <br>

    * Basic goal of ISO 27001: 
        * To protect three aspects of information:
            * Confidentiality
            * Integrity
            * Availability
    <br>

    * ISMS ruleset:
        1. Identify stakeholder's expectations of company in terms of information security

        2. Indentify which risks exist for information security

        3. Defining controls and other mitigation methods to meet identified expectations and handle risks

        4. Setting clear objectives on what needs to be achieved with information security

        5. Implementing all controls and other risk treatment methods

        6. Continuously measuring if implemented controls perform as expected

        7. Making continuous improvement to make ISMS work better

    <br>

    * Reasons for requiring ISMS:
        1. Comply with legal requirements
            * ISO27001 resolves most of requirements of laws, regulations and contracts regarding information security

        <br>

        2. Achieve competitive advantages
            * ISO27001 certified organisations can be more competitive in their industry

        <br>

        3. Lower cost
            * Preventing security incidents from happening will enable organisation to save money

        <br>

        4. Better organisation
            * ISO27001 helps company set up procedures and processes for information security easily
        
    <br>

    * Functionality of ISO 27001
        * Main functionality is to manage risks by finding out where risks are then systematically treat them through implemetation of security controls

        * Risk assesment and treament &#8594; Safeguard implementations

    <br>

    * 14 Domains of ISO 27001
        1. Information Security
        
        2. Operations security

        3. Organisation of information security

        4. Communications security

        5. Human Resources security

        6. System acquisition, developement and maintenance

        7. Asset management

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework

- National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CS)
    * A framework

    * Set of guidelines and best practices to help organisation build and improve cybersecurity posture
        * Framework put forth a set of reccomendations and standards that enable organisations to better prepare indentifying and detecting cyber attacks and also provides guidelines on how to respond, prevent and recover from cyber incidents

    <br>

    * Considered as essential standard for building up cybersecurity program

    <br>

    * 5 core functions of NIST CSF
        1. Identify
            * Recognising processes and assets that need protection

        <br>

        2. Protect
            * Implementing appropriate safeguards to ensure protection of enterprise's assets

        <br>

        3. Detect

        <br>

        4. Respond
            * Developing techniques to contain impacts of cybersecurity events
        
        <br>

        5. Recover
            * Implmenting appropriate process to restore capabilties and services impaired due to cybersecurity events
